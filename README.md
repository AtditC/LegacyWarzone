# Warzone
Minehut's Warzone plugin supports thousands of unique players on a weekly basis. It's modular design it to support multiple game-types on a per-map basis without needing to restart the server. 

## Setup
Just run `mvn clean install` inside of the directory to build the project. We used Intellij to develop this plugin and strongly urge you too as well!

## Things to note
1. Dev environments are currently not supported. I'l be adding an easy way to setup a test server soon.

## About Warzone's Code
Warzone originally started as a fork of [Cardinal](https://github.com/twizmwazin/CardinalPGM), a fantastic open source plugin. Minehut's team has since redesigned many core aspects of the plugin, including a conversion to JSON instead of XML and reworking the majority of the integral game-controlling modules.
